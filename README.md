# Bookmark Manager
Rails is a full-stack framework. It is a server-side web application with all the tools needed to build web apps. 
Using Capybara with RSpec and Sinatra. I am launching a Rubyb web project. 
 - Using TDD I will first test the index page for my bookmark manager.
  - 

## User Story #1
> - As a soft-life user
> - So I can access websites quickly
> - I can view a list of bookmarked websites

In order to create the ability to add bookmarks onto the web page we must first create a database and table for information to be stored.
Using SQL and database manager Postgres we will use `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` to create, update and delete database entries to fullfill the following user story:

## User Story #2
> - As a time-pressed user
> - So that I can save a website
> - I would like to add the site's address and title to bookmark manager

## User Story #3
> - As a user
> - So I can remove bookmarks I no longer need
> - I can delete bookmarks


> - As a user I can Update bookmarks
> - As a user I can Comment on bookmarks
- As a user I can Tag bookmarks into categories
- As a user I can Filter bookmarks by tag
- As a user I can restrict user to manage only their own bookmarks
